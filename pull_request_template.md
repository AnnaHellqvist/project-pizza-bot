My reflections on how this week's project turned out:

- The task was perfect for learning the basics of conditionals and functions in JavaScript. 
- Pair programming was fun! We're very happy with the result, especially that we manage to hide and show different parts in our application depending on the step of the process. 

If we had more time we would have loved to:

- add the possibility to choose more than one kind of pizza
- add some more prices for different pizzas
- add a progress bar
- add a receipt in the end of the order

Things I'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail:

- We would love to learn more about how to use arguments in JavaScript. What is an appropriate argument in a function, and how to use it?
