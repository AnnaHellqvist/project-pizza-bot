# Pizza Bot
Focus for this assigment was to build a pizza bot using JavaScript functions and conditional statements.

## The problem

We started with solving the iterations given in the project brief, and from there we decided which functions we would need for our pizza bot. We wanted to use a form in HTML to collect user input and use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. 

We used conditional statements to control which output is shown to the user (messages, images and so on).
